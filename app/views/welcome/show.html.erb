        <h2>Integrate Cobot with Slack</h2>
        <p>This <a href="http://cobot.me/addons">add-on</a> connects your spaceâ€™s Cobot account with your <a href="http://slack.com">slack.com</a> account. This means that new members who are added through Cobot will automatically be invited to join your Slack team, so you don't have to add them manually.</p>


        <p>Now that they have been added to your Slack channel, you have a communication point for everyone in your space to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Talk about what is happening in the space</li>
          <li>Post events</li>
          <li>Welcome new members</li>
          <li>Announce packages delivered to the space</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The sky is the limit!</p>
        <p><%= link_to 'Get Started now', sign_in_path, class: 'btn btn--full btn--hl btn--biggest' %></p>
