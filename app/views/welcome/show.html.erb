        <h2>Integrate Cobot with Slack</h2>
        <p>This <a href="http://cobot.me/addons">add-on</a> connects your spaceâ€™s Cobot account with your <a href="http://slack.com">slack.com</a> account. This means that new members who are added through Cobot will automatically be invited to join your Slack team, so you don't have to add them manually.</p>

        <p>Now that they have been added to your Slack channel, you have a communication point for everyone in your space to do the following, for example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Talk about what is happening in the space</li>
          <li>Post events</li>
          <li>Welcome new members</li>
          <li>Announce packages delivered to the space</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The sky is the limit!</p>
        <p><%= link_to 'Get Started now', sign_in_path, class: 'btn btn--full btn--hl btn--biggest' %></p>

        <h2>What is Slack?</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> is arguably the best team communication application there is, used by companies around the world, including Cobot. It allows you to manage communication between team members and various online accounts in one application.

        <p>It offers:</p>
        <ul>

          <li>emojis ðŸ˜€</li>
          <li>full-text search & archiving</li>
          <li>mobile apps</li>
          <li><a href="https://slack.com/integrations">integrations</a> with services such as Google Docs, Dropbox, email, Google calendar, Trello, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Their <a href="https://cobot.slack.com/pricing">free account</a> offers unlimited members. The only limits are on file uploads, a maximum of 10 service integrations, and limited access to the message archive.</p>
